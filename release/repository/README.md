# World War VR

World War VR is a standalone VR mod for the Windows version of **Call of Duty: World at War**. It adds stereo OpenXR rendering, 6DOF head tracking, motion-controller aiming, VR input, room-space menu panels, and a standalone launcher.

> **Pre-release status:** Zombies is the primary supported mode. Multiplayer and Campaign are experimental. Read [Known Issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) before downloading.

## Download and install

Download the latest **`WorldWarVR-Setup.exe`** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RyanCraighead/WorldWarVR-Releases/releases), run it, and open **World War VR** from the Start Menu.

The launcher normally finds a Steam installation automatically. If it does not, choose **Browse** and select the Call of Duty: World at War installation folder. Pick a launch target and VR quality preset, then select **Launch in VR**. The chosen folder and settings are remembered.

After installation, right-click **World War VR** and select **Run as
administrator** when starting the launcher. Launch the game through World War
VR rather than opening the game executable directly.

## Tested headsets and connection methods

The following reflects hardware and connection methods tested so far:

| Headset and connection | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Meta Quest 2 through Virtual Desktop | **Working** | This is the currently recommended wireless Quest 2 connection. |
| Meta Quest 3 through Virtual Desktop | **Working** | Virtual Desktop is a confirmed working wireless connection for Quest 3. |
| Meta Quest 2 through Air Link | **Working** | This route requires selecting the **SteamVR Beta** branch in Steam. SteamVR does not need to be opened manually; connect through Air Link and enable the SteamVR compatibility option in the World War VR launcher. |
| Meta Quest 2 through Steam Link | **Not Working** | This connection is not currently considered a supported working route. |
| Meta Rift S through Meta Horizon Link | **Working** | Tested using Meta as the active OpenXR launcher/runtime. |
| Meta Rift S through SteamVR | **Working** | Tested with SteamVR as the active OpenXR runtime. |

Other OpenXR headsets and connection methods may work, but have not yet been
personally verified. If a headset fails, include the connection method and
active OpenXR runtime in the bug report.

## Current mode support

| Mode | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Zombies | **Working / primary** | The most tested and recommended way to play. |
| Local/offline multiplayer | **Experimental** | Some maps or modes remain broken. Optional automatic bots are available for local play when the supported user-supplied bot package is present. |
| Campaign | **Experimental** | Incompletely tested. Progression may currently fail around the second mission. |
| Online multiplayer | **Unsupported** | Not supported or tested. |

## Launcher options

- Automatic Steam installation detection or a manually selected compatible game folder
- **Main Menu — Zombies and Campaign** or **Multiplayer** launch targets
- Optional automatic bots for local/offline multiplayer
- **Recommended**, **High Quality**, and **Performance** VR resolution presets
- Saved settings, so normal setup is required only once

## Optional multiplayer bots

World War VR can automatically install and configure nine PeZBOT players for
local/offline multiplayer. PeZBOT itself is not included in the installer.
One-time setup:

1. Download [PeZBOT 005p for World at War](https://www.moddb.com/mods/pezbot/downloads/pezbot-005p-for-world-at-war).
2. Leave `PeZBOTWAW_005p.zip` unextracted in your Windows **Downloads** folder.
3. Open World War VR, select **Multiplayer**, and enable **Automatic Bots**.
4. Select **Launch in VR**, then create a local game with **Dedicated** set to
   **No**. The launcher verifies and installs the archive automatically.

Do not extract the ZIP or copy bot files into the game folder. After the first
successful import, the launcher uses its verified private installation and the
downloaded ZIP is no longer required. If bots do not appear, confirm that the
download is the exact `PeZBOTWAW_005p.zip` archive and restart the launcher.

## Requirements

- A lawfully obtained, compatible Windows installation of Call of Duty: World at War
- Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or newer, 64-bit
- An OpenXR-compatible PC VR headset and active OpenXR runtime
- Two tracked motion controllers for the complete control scheme

The game, maps, and bot package are not included. See [Requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) for details.

## Controls

The right controller aims the visible weapon. The right trigger fires, the left grip throws the secondary/tactical grenade, and the sticks handle movement and snap turning. Click the right stick or make a fast outward swing with the right controller to melee. Native menus appear on a panel in front of the player and can be pointed at with the right controller.

See the complete [VR controls](CONTROLS.md).

## Media

Actual gameplay screenshots and a headset-capture video will be added before the repository is made public. Only captures from a tested release build will be used.

## Reporting a problem

Check [Known Issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md), then [open a bug report](https://github.com/RyanCraighead/WorldWarVR-Releases/issues/new) with the mode, map or mission, headset, graphics card, resolution preset, and steps needed to reproduce the issue.
